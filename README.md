# Sound Reaver
Plays the soundtrack of [Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_of_Kain:_Soul_Reaver) with a toggle to switch between the spectral and material variant of each track.

The soundtrack was composed by [Kurt Harland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Harland) and remastered by [DeeDyne](https://github.com/DeeDyne) & [SalsaGal](https://github.com/SalsaGal). This app only contains titles that are available in both the spectral and material variants.

[The work](https://www.deviantart.com/convalise/gallery/29182860/legacy-of-kain) of [Conrado (convalise)](https://www.deviantart.com/convalise/about) was used for the app and package icons.
