Hello from DeeDyne!

This is the soundtrack from "Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver" ripped directly and entirely from the game files for the first time ever!
Before this, the community had to resort to manually record all of the dynamic music while the game was running.
Well, no more!

Thanks to the goal achieved in this project, the proprietary in-game formats have finally been converted to standard SoundFonts/DLSes and MIDI files.
With this trick you can basically have full control on how the music plays without having to rely on the game engine.
You can also gain access to hidden sequences that the game wouldn't normally play, not even by forcing it with cheat software.
You can then literally import everything into your digital audio workstation of choice and do whatever you want.
You can remaster the soundtrack like I did, do all kinds of detailed finetuning or you can even make remixes.
I've probably only scratched the surface on what the possibilities could be.
Go nuts! Have fun with the files and enjoy this remaster!

Special credits and thanks go to:
1) Both the LoK and the Tomb Raider fan and modding community on Discord,
for providing the core ingredients, information and knowledge to make attacking this problem possible;
2) SalsaGal,
for dedicating so much of her time in helping me develop the tools and lending plenty of her knowledge on Rust;

You guys all rock!!!
You may not realize it, but you constantly made me feel motivated to continue working on this project for months.
Everything that came from all of you helped greatly, from the knowledge to the positive vibes.
You've helped me get through a tough period of my life by simply being awesome people who showed great enthusiasm.

Without your great help and support, this project would have not been possible.

-The time when I had the initial idea for this project: mid-2013
-The project started on: 2023/10/27
-Finished: 2024/07/15

Thank you guys <3
